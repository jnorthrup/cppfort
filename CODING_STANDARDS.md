your permissions outside of git are to maintain Cmake, ninja, and source files, and checking in build outputs is forbidden.

no shell, python, or  any other scripts are allowed in the repository.

Do not create markdown or documentation changes withoiut asking.  if they don't exist, i certainly have no interest in adding them and they are not required for the project.  if you have a question about this, ask.

no source code is above src/ and no test code is above tests/

DO NOT RUN A TEST PROCESS WITHOUT TIMEOUT or   '< /dev/null'
