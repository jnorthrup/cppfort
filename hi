  Implementation Mismatches:
  - References advanced_graph_solutions.cpp (Step 2a) - file does not exist in repository
  - Mentions cpp2_mlir_assembler.cpp (Step 5b) - no such file in codebase
  - References bnfc_cpp2_complete.yaml (Step 4b) - pattern file not present
  - Step 6b mentions cpp2_emitter.cpp and depth_pattern_matcher.cpp as "brittle" and needing deletion - git status shows these files were already deleted in commit 254fe1f

  Conceptual Flaws:
  - Step 1 proposes enhancing WideScanner::scanAnchorsSIMD for boundary classification, but provides no mechanism for character class determination beyond token position
  - Step 3 describes "wobbling window" for confix inference but fails to address escape sequences, string literals, or comments that would break naive depth counting
  - Step 4's PatternApplier operates on text content of RegionNode while Step 3 suggests regions are determined by boundary events - circular dependency

  Missing Critical Components:
  - No mention of comment stripping or preprocessor handling (Step 1 boundary classification would detect # as punctuation)
  - No error recovery strategy when confix depth never returns to zero
  - No specification for identifier/keyword disambiguation at boundary level
  - Assumes YAML patterns exist for all language constructs without verification

  Git Status Inconsistencies:
  - Plan written as if starting fresh, but codebase shows extensive modifications: rbcursive.cpp modified, test_reality_check.cpp modified, multiple new files added
  - Step 6 deletion instructions are obsolete - files already removed

  Technical Debt Introduced:
  - Proposes creating parallel infrastructure (OpStub, ValueStub) while MLIR already has these abstractions
  - Suggests building complete graph representation in memory before MLIR generation - unnecessary intermediate state
  - No performance analysis of storing boundary stream as std::vector<BoundaryEvent> for large files

  The plan reads as theoretical design document, not executable roadmap matching current repository state.
