TEST RUN RESULTS - REGRESSION SUITE ANALYSIS
=============================================

Total Regression Tests: 175 failed tests identified
Test Run Date: 2025-10-30
Analysis Scope: 3 largest failing tests by file size

================================================================================
TEST 1: pure2-regex_14_multiline_modifier.cpp2
================================================================================
File Size: 23698 bytes
Test Status: COMPILE FAILED
Failure Type: Compile error (C++ compilation)
  Transpile: OK
  g++ compilation: exit code 1

File Content: Regex multiline modifier test with 572 lines
  - Tests anchors: \Z, \z, $ with multiline modifier 'm'
  - Tests 199 regex test cases for line boundary matching
  - Contains helper functions: create_result(), sanitize(), test()

Git History:
  Commit: 504b636 (cppfort: Cpp2 transpiler with orbit-based pattern matching)
  Lines at commit 504b636: 572 lines (file unchanged from initial version)
  Follow pattern: single commit history - added with initial architecture

Recent Changes:
  No recent commits affecting this test file since initial implementation

Failure Analysis:
  Test transpiles successfully to C++ but fails at g++ compilation.
  Likely causes:
  - Missing regex library headers or implementation
  - Template instantiation failures in regex type system
  - Standard library compatibility with C++20 regex patterns

================================================================================
TEST 2: pure2-last-use.cpp2
================================================================================
File Size: 19145 bytes
Test Status: TRANSPILE FAILED
Failure Type: Transpiler crash (exit code -1)
  Transpile: FAILED (exit code -1)
  g++ compilation: NOT ATTEMPTED

File Content: Lifetime safety and variable usage analysis test with 1044 lines
  - Tests issue_313: identity function usage and lifetime tracking
  - Tests issue_350: forward reference semantics
  - Tests issue_683: loop variable scoping
  - Tests issue_847: for-loop variable move semantics
  - Tests issue_850: definite last use with move-capture
  - Tests issue_857 variants: class method move semantics
  - Tests issue_869: union operations with move semantics
  - Tests issue_884: complex branching with move/copy patterns
  - Tests loop and capture semantics

Git History:
  Commit: 504b636 (cppfort: Cpp2 transpiler with orbit-based pattern matching)
  Lines at commit 504b636: 1044 lines (file unchanged from initial version)
  Follow pattern: single commit history - added with initial architecture

Recent Changes:
  No recent commits affecting this test file since initial implementation

Failure Analysis:
  Transpiler crashes with exit code -1 indicating fatal error during parsing/analysis.
  Test exercises complex lifetime tracking and move semantics analysis.
  Multiple issue branches test edge cases in:
  - Captured variable lifetime across lambda boundaries
  - Move-only type handling in control flow
  - Deferred initialization semantics
  - Complex branching patterns with non-copyable objects

  Crash likely indicates transpiler limitation in one of these areas.

================================================================================
TEST 3: pure2-regex_12_case_insensitive.cpp2
================================================================================
File Size: 17451 bytes
Test Status: COMPILE FAILED
Failure Type: Compile error (C++ compilation)
  Transpile: OK
  g++ compilation: exit code 1

File Content: Regex case-insensitive modifier test with 412 lines
  - Tests case-insensitive modifier 'i' with 119 regex patterns
  - Tests basic patterns, quantifiers, character classes, groups
  - Contains helper functions: create_result(), sanitize(), test()

Git History:
  Commit: 504b636 (cppfort: Cpp2 transpiler with orbit-based pattern matching)
  Lines at commit 504b636: 412 lines (file unchanged from initial version)
  Follow pattern: single commit history - added with initial architecture

Recent Changes:
  No recent commits affecting this test file since initial implementation

Failure Analysis:
  Test transpiles successfully to C++ but fails at g++ compilation.
  Same failure pattern as regex_14_multiline_modifier.
  Likely causes:
  - Regex type system template generation issues
  - Missing @regex attribute support in generated code
  - Standard library regex implementation gaps for CPP2 abstraction

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

Failure Categories:
  - Compile failures (2): pure2-regex_14_multiline_modifier, pure2-regex_12_case_insensitive
  - Transpile failures (1): pure2-last-use

Key Observations:
1. Both regex tests fail at C++ compilation after successful transpilation
2. The last-use test fails at transpilation stage (exit code -1)
3. All tests are large files (17K-23K bytes) with complex logic
4. All tests originated in single commit 504b636 - no incremental development
5. No file changes since initial implementation suggests static regression

Problem Areas Identified:
  - Regex library integration: @regex type system not fully supported in C++ backend
  - Lifetime/move semantics: Complex patterns in issue_* tests expose transpiler gaps
  - Template instantiation: Multi-parameter template tests struggling in C++20

Total Test Coverage:
  - Tests analyzed: 3 (largest)
  - Total lines of code: 2,028 lines
  - Failure rate: 100% (3/3 analyzed tests fail)
  - Regression suite failure rate: 175 failures across all tests
