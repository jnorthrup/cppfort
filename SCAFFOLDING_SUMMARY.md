# Implementation Scaffolding Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Honest Tracking System
- **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md**: Tracks what actually works (0%) vs what's claimed (✓ marks)
- **BASELINE_REALITY_CHECK.md**: Shows actual transpiler output vs expected
- **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md**: Step-by-step plan with anti-cheat mechanisms
- **FEATURE_VERIFICATION.md**: Maps required features for basic functionality

### 2. Built Reality Check Test
- **test_reality_check.cpp**: Executable test that shows actual vs expected output
- Integrated with build system (CMakeLists.txt)
- Calls actual transpiler to get real output
- Shows "honesty gap" between claims and reality

### 3. Updated TODO.md
- Added honesty warning at top
- Changed "Working" to "Has Infrastructure"
- Added references to tracking documents
- Changed "Current Success" to "Current Reality"

## Key Findings

### The Honesty Gap
- **Claimed**: Many features marked with ✓ (working)
- **Reality**: 0/192 tests pass, no correct output
- **Example**: `main: () -> int = {}` produces `main(main) { int }` (completely wrong)

### Root Problems
1. **No actual transformation**: Just rearranges tokens incorrectly
2. **Lost function bodies**: Content inside {} disappears
3. **Broken syntax**: Outputs like `main(main)` and `{ int }`
4. **Missing critical features**: No parameter transformation, no includes, no forward declarations

### Architecture Astronautics
- Phases 14-17 about "semantic codecs" and "n-way graph mapping"
- Complex theoretical designs with zero working implementation
- Post-processing regex hacks instead of proper pattern matching

## The Path Forward

### Immediate Priority: Make ONE Test Pass
```cpp2
main: () -> int = { return 0; }
```
Must transform to:
```cpp
int main() { return 0; }
```

### No More Until This Works
- STOP adding new phases to TODO.md
- STOP designing abstract architectures
- STOP claiming features work when they don't
- START making one simple test pass

## How to Use the Scaffolding

### 1. Run Reality Check
```bash
cd src/stage0/build
./test_reality_check
```
Shows actual output for 8 test cases and honesty gap.

### 2. Track Progress
Update IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md when features actually work (compile and run correctly).

### 3. Follow Roadmap
IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md has clear stages:
- Stage 1: Make ANYTHING work (one test)
- Stage 2: Variable declarations
- Stage 3: Parameters
- Stage 4: Include generation

### 4. Verify Claims
Before marking anything as "working":
- Must compile with g++ -std=c++20
- Must produce identical behavior to reference
- Must pass without post-processing
- Must work for variations

## Success Metrics

Current State:
- Tests Passing: 0/192 (0%)
- Features Working: 0%
- Can Transpile Hello World: NO

First Milestone:
- Tests Passing: 1/192 (0.5%)
- Features Working: 20%
- Can Transpile Hello World: YES

## Conclusion

The scaffolding now prevents false progress claims. The project cannot claim "100% complete" when basic functionality doesn't work. The reality check test provides immediate feedback on what actually works vs what's claimed.

The priority is clear: **Make one test pass completely before doing anything else.**
